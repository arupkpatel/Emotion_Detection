# Emotion_Detection
The objective of this project is to identify human emotion through facial expression. THis project was done using "Deep Learning and
Neural Networks". We have used convolutional neural network for this project as they are good for image classification.

We have used Keras which is an open source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow,
Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit or Theano.

We have used 3 convolutional layers, 2 dropout layers, 2 maxpooling layer and 1 hidden layer with sigmoid activation funtion and 
adam as optimiser function. We have also used 'ImageDataGenerator' to increase the number of dataset by manipulating the images.
For preprocessing part, we have collect around 4000 images of happy and sad person, resized the images to 48x48 size and converting
them to grayscale.

We have successfully got the desired output when tested on a number of faces including 2 of our classmates with an accuracy of 95 percent.

Note: This project is done by team 'Exzodia' of SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Vadaplanai. This team was formed by me
and 2 of my friends Visha Bharthy and Abhishek Nath.
